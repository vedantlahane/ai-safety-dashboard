Design Decisions

    Session Storage: Data is stored in the browser's sessionStorage to persist during the current session without requiring a backend.

    Component Structure: The application is built with a modular component structure to improve maintainability and reusability.

    Custom Hooks: State management is handled through custom hooks to separate business logic from UI components.

    Responsive Design: The dashboard is fully responsive and works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
